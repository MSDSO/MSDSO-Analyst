```fix
Is there a wait time between repeating a class?
```
> - Retaking a course vs Qdropping: If a student completes a course and earns a grade lower than what is specified in the program of work, they will need to retake the course. Students will not have to wait two long semesters, they can take the course again as soon as it is available to them.
> - If they QF drop a course after the 20th class day, they will need to wait two long semesters.
