"Hi everyone - Welcome to our TidyTuesday channel! 

**The intent of this is to offer students a means of practicing their R datawrangling and data visualization skills in a setting which allows for sharing and collaborative learning.** We encourage students to post their work, and also to offer support to their fellow students!

The TidyTuesday project offers raw public datasets for datascientists to practice and share their skills.

**tidytuesday github**: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday
 
We will initially be hosting this channel for the Data Exploration and Visualization class, and will consider moving it under the Programming channels later if there is interest and momentum."

--------------------
**Getting Started**

It is recommended that you install the R packages recommended for DSC 385 (found here: https://wilkelab.org/DSC385/). 

For those new to R, please also install the following:
- https://www.r-project.org/ 
- https://www.rstudio.com/

Additionally, for those who don't already have a https://github.com/ account, it is highly encouraged that you register (we get a pro account free as UT MSDSO students) to practice your version control skills, and to give yourself a platform to share your work with others.

Data for tidytuesday can be retrieved two ways:

- `tt_load` from the `tidytuesdayR` package
- directly from github using `read_csv` 
```
file <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/xxxx/xxxx/file.csv
```

We will be opening up a new thread every week for new tidytuesday challenges. Please join these threads to share data visualizations, approaches, and give feedback to your peers!
